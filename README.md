# faveMovies Object-oriented App
This is a JavaScript app for adding your favourite movies.
I have used ES6 classes (instead of ES5 constructors). It has three classes for movies, the userinterface and local storage and a few event listeners which call these classes inside them.
I enjoyed making this app by watching Brad Traversy's JS course. I have added my own changes to this app and this is not a copy and paste project!

This was my second time making this app and this time I can certainly say I understood nearly all of the concept that he tries to teach through this app mainly being how ES6 classes make it object-oriented. 
I still need to work on understanding local storage more though :)
